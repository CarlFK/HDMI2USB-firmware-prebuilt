INFO: [Project 1-236] Implementation specific constraints were found while reading constraint file [/home/travis/build/timvideos/HDMI2USB-litex-firmware/build/arty_base_picorv32/gateware/top.xdc]. These constraints will be ignored for synthesis but will be used in implementation. Impacted constraints are listed in the file [.Xil/top_propImpl.xdc].
Resolution: To avoid this warning, move constraints listed in [.Xil/top_propImpl.xdc] to another XDC file and exclude this new file from synthesis with the used_in_synthesis property (File Properties dialog in GUI) and re-run elaboration/synthesis.

Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.
